## Operating System Images

Images written to SD cards are the quickest way to get running on a Raspberry Pi. There are a large number of images available:

- [Lightweight](#lightweight--slim) - Focused on being small/thin/lightweight and optimized, allowing you to dedicate more system resources to your specific applications.
- [Full](#full) - Provides entire operation system and desktop UI.
- [Specialized](#specialized) - Customized distributions focusing on particular applications or purposes.
